# 🧪 Lab Overview

This home lab is part of a multi-stage cybersecurity learning series focused on **detection engineering and telemetry analysis**.

Rather than following isolated tool tutorials, the lab is designed to simulate **real attacker behavior** and observe how that activity appears from a defender’s perspective.

The emphasis is on:
- generating realistic endpoint telemetry
- understanding how tools interact
- identifying why things *don’t* work when assumptions are wrong

This repository documents the process honestly — including mistakes, misconfigurations, and fixes.
