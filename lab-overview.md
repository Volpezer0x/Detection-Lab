# 🧪 Lab Overview

This lab simulates a basic endpoint compromise to study how attacker actions generate telemetry and how that data is analyzed in Splunk.

Focus areas:
- Windows + Sysmon telemetry
- SIEM ingestion and parsing
- Manual detection via SPL
- Process lineage and command-line analysis

This is a **defensive, learning-focused lab** designed to build investigation and detection engineering fundamentals.
