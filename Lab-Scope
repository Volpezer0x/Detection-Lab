# 🔎 Lab Scope

This lab focuses on **endpoint-focused detection**, not perimeter security or advanced malware development.

## ✅ In Scope
- Endpoint telemetry generation
- Process, network, and command-line visibility
- Sysmon logging
- Splunk ingestion and field extraction
- Basic attack simulation (scanning, payload execution)

## ❌ Out of Scope
- Exploit development
- Live malware deployment
- Internet-facing infrastructure
- Production security hardening

> ⚠️ **All testing is performed in an isolated virtual environment.**

# 🎯 Lab Objectives

By completing this lab, you will learn to:
1. Simulate attacker behavior in a safe lab
2. Generate realistic telemetry on Windows endpoints
3. Parse and analyze telemetry in Splunk
4. Convert raw telemetry into actionable detection logic
