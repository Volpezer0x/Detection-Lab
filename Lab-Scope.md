# 🔎 Lab Context

This lab focuses on **endpoint-focused detection**, not perimeter security or advanced malware development.

## 🎯 Scope

### In Scope
- Endpoint telemetry generation
- Process, network, and command-line visibility
- Sysmon logging
- Splunk ingestion and field extraction
- Basic attack simulation (scanning, payload execution)

### Out of Scope
- Exploit development
- Live malware deployment
- Internet-facing infrastructure
- Production security hardening

All testing is performed in an **isolated virtual environment**.

## 🧩 Lab Philosophy

- Learn by doing, not just reading
- Document mistakes and fixes
- Build skills transferable to real SOC/blue team work
