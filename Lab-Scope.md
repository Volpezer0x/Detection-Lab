# 🔎 Lab Scope & Context

This lab focuses on **endpoint detection engineering**, not exploit development or red-team operations.

The primary goal is to understand:
- how attacker actions generate telemetry
- how endpoints log activity
- how SIEMs ingest and normalize logs
- where visibility breaks down

---

## ✅ In Scope

- Endpoint telemetry generation
- Process, network, and command-line logging
- Sysmon configuration and tuning
- Splunk ingestion and search
- Basic attack simulation

---

## ❌ Out of Scope

- Exploit development
- Internet-facing infrastructure
- Live malware deployment
- Production hardening

All testing is performed in an **isolated lab network**.
